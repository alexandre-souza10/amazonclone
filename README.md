## Project Description:
- In this Project, an Amazon clone page was developed, a Front-End project, using HTML, CSS, Java Script, and the API.themoviedb.org. On the page we find
a more advanced design, and very functional for its purpose. Pulling all the movies dynamically from the API , and making them visible on the screen in a well - styled , but static way
being able to only see the list of existing movies pulled by the API.

- The project has the functionality of having a catalog of films updated at the moment, pulled dynamically from the API, and leaving them static, as it is a Front-End project only,
just being a catalog of films dynamically updated according to the API.

- Below we have a small instructional video, where we show an example of how the Amazon Clone page works.
